## Introduction

In this project, we will explore and implement different algorithms using Python. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience for algorithmic problem-solving.

## Algorithms

### Binary Search

Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target element is found or determined to be not present.

### Linear Search

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

### Decision Tree

Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input features.
